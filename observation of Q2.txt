-the periods between beats is smaller compared to that of the
  normal ECG of Problem 1.

-and that indicates that the Heart rate is greater compared to normal ECG of Problem 1.

-Lag = 241 samples

  = 241* 1/512 = 0.470703 sec

-The average Heart Rate = 127.57616



* My suggestion is the Heart rate itself - maximum normal heart rate ( 100 ) which we can calculate as follows : 

** AF_measure = 60 / ( Lag / 512 ) - 100 **


- AF_measure of problem 2 = 27.576

- AF_measure of problem 1 = -`32.48352  ( the negative means that this person doesn't suffer Atrial Fibrillation )
